I'm a bot helping you practice LeetCode problems. Just tell me what coding problems you'd like to practice again \
and I'll help you schedule the next rounds based on the forgetting curve.

Check all available actions with /help.`
const help = `<b>What can this bot do?</b>

This is a bot that can intelligently schedule your next LeetCode problems to practice again based on \
the forgetting curve. It uses a simple yet powerful model of forgetting (similar to Duolingo) to let you practice \
problems with least recall probabilities.

<a href="https://github.com/SiyanH/leetrepeat-bot">Code</a> is open source on GitHub.
